first iteration features:
20 evenly spaced samples from 0hz to 5hz

later iterations:
more spaced samples as features (max out at abt 50-60)
add in more calculated features:
total_power,max_power,crest_factor,spectral_entropy,spectral_centroid_norm,spectral_skewness,spectral_kurtosis,shoulder_power_ratio,outer_power_ratio
more ideas:
Spectral flatness / kurtosis
Adjacent channel power ratio (ACPR)
Harmonic distortion ratios
Main-band power
Regrowth power
